# SABRE-II Web App

Super Automated Bumpin' Request Engine or SABRE II is an interactive app allows users to create and organize music playlists based on user upvotes. Songs can be searched using the apple music API and they will be added to the queue. People can queue songs and upvote them. The most popular songs will be played first.  The Web App side (this one) is made for users to add songs to the queue whereas the mobile iOS app side is made to be the "DJ" and physically play the music through a speaker.

The mobile app side of the project can be found at https://github.com/skylermaxwell42/SABRE-II-Mobile
