# CSC - 470: Advanced Browser Technologies

In this course, I learned how to work with JavaScript and HTML. We focused on the basics of JS and gradually built up to more complicated projects. This repository contains the Labs and Projects assigned in this course.

## The Layout

There are two main folders in this repository, Labs and Projects. The Labs typically contain smaller, basic tasks while the projects combine multiple JS/HTML functionalities in to a single task. Each of the individual labs and projects have a .pdf assosciated with them. This .pdf has all the information on what the assignment at hand was. 

**NOTE:** Labs 8 and 10 and Project 4 are required to be opened with a server in order for them to work properly. To do this, I hosted an http server using python. The command in python3 is :
```python
python -m http.server
```
This command will open the server on a indicated port where the user can then navigate to in their broswer. Once there, open the desired .html file and the program will work as intended.
